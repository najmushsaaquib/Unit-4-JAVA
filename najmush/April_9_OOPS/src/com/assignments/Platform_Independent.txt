Unlike other programming language, JAVA creates a ".class" file while compiling the ".java" source code file which also knowns as "Byte Code".

It doesn't matter on which platform you are, if you device has JVM installed in it. You can run that "Byte Code" which was generated when the java code was complied. 

Hence in order to run the "Byte Code", it doesn't need to depend on a platform. And that is why, JAVA is a platform-independent programming language.
