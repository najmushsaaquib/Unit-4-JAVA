What is the difference between the Checked and Unchecked exceptions explain it
with an example? 


CHECKED EXCEPTION :-
-----------------

					While compiling any java source code, the compiler scans the whole program for
					any faulty code or syntactical errors. Or a code that may throw an exceptions 
					at compile time and doesn't compile the code into machine code. 
					These exceptions are known as Checked Exceptions.
					Since, due to checked exception compiler doesn't compile the code into machine
					code, these are also knows as Compile-time exceptions.
					
					
					
					we can resolve checked exception by providing try-catch block;
					The class that directly inherit the throwable class except RuntimeException
				 	and Error are called checked exception.
					
					example:
					IOExceptions, SQLException,etc
					

UNCHECKED EXCEPTION:-
--------------------


					Those exception which are not checked at compile time,but they are
					checked at runtime are known as Unchecked Exceptions.
					The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exception.
					
					example :
								ArithmaticException,NullpointerException ArrayIndexPutOfBountsException etc.

	
	

How to create a User-defined unchecked exception class?
			
			
			The RuntimeException class is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions. Hence we can create a
			 custom unchecked exception by extending RuntimeException class.
			
				public class NullPointerException extends RuntimeException{
				
					NullPointerException(String errorMessage){
					super(errorMessage);
					
					}
					
					NullPointerException(){
					}
					
				}
