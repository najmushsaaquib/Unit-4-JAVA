 #String :-
   1) Strings are Immutable - Once the value is assigned, you can't reassing the same value to a String Variable.
   2) Strings are made in SCP (String Constant Pool) which is inside the Heap Area of the RAM.
  
   	  Example :
	  String str = "example of String";
  
   
 #StringBuffer :-
   1) Unlike String, StringBuffer is mutable, meaning you can reassign or modify the value of a StringBuffer variable as many times as you like. 
   2) StringBuffer are thread safe. 
   3) Due to thread safe, String buffer is slow in performance.
   
	  
	  Example :
	  StringBuffer anotherStr = new StringBuffer("example of StringBuffer");   
   
 #StringBuilder :-
    1) 1) Similiar to StringBuffer,  StringBuilder is also mutable.
    2) StringBuilder are not considered to be thread safe.
    3) Since it is not thread safe, StringBuilder is comparitably faster than StringBuffer
   
   		Example:
   		StringBuilder modifiedStr = new StringBuilder("example of StringBuilder");
   
   
   
   #tostring();
   
   toString(); method is used to convert the Object Representation into a String value
    If we try to print an Object, by default toString() method is called and it prints the class name, + "@" + some hexadecimal hascode of the Object
